##TopBot

Automation tool for the game Tales of Pirates.

###About

- This project was made in 2007 and it was developed in AutoIt3 using SciTE4AutoIt3
- The project, code and comments are in English, but there might be some inconsistencies.
- I made this bot to aid me and my friends on a game that we were playing at the time; this tool probably does not comply with the TOS of the game.
- Please note that this project was made in 2007, my knowledge and programming skills have evolved since. So there might be bugs, code inconsistencies and wrong architectural decisions.
- This bot works by scraping and then simulates normal user behavior. It does not manipulate memory regions of the game itself.

###Features

- AFK functions for class Tank and SharpShooter.
- Leveling functions, for any class, it will follow the enemies.
- GM Finder, it searches for the presence of a GameMaster and disconnects the user for some time to prevent problems.
- AutoHP, automatically drinks posions if the HP drops bellow X%.
- This bot works best in fullscreen, but also supports window mode for some game resolutions.
- All the used keys and delays are configurable.
